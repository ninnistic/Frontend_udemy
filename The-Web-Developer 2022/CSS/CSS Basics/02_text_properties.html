    <h1>Tomatoes</h1>
    <p>
        The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum,[1][2] commonly known as the tomato plant. The
        species originated in western South America, Mexico, and Central America.[2][3] The Mexican Nahuatl word tomatl
        <a href="#nowhere">gave</a> rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived.[3][4]
        Its domestication and
        use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.[2][5] The Aztecs used
        tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish
        encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe,
        in a widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian exchange. From there, the tomato was introduced to
        other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.[2]

        Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.[6] They are consumed in diverse ways: raw or cooked, and in
        many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are
        commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.[3]

    <h2>Names</h2>
    <p>
        Pronunciation
        The usual pronunciations of tomato are /təˈmeɪtoʊ/ (usual in American English) and /təˈmɑːtoʊ/ (usual in British
        English).[8] The word's dual pronunciations were immortalized in Ira and George Gershwin's 1937 song "Let's Call
        the Whole Thing Off" ("You like /pəˈteɪtoʊ/ and I like /pəˈtɑːtoʊ/ / You like /təˈmeɪtoʊ/ and I like
        /təˈmɑːtoʊ/") and have become a symbol for nitpicking pronunciation disputes.[citation needed] In this capacity,
        it has even become an American and British slang term: saying "/təˈmeɪtoʊ təˈmɑːtoʊ/" when presented with two
        choices can mean "What's the difference?" or "It's all the same to me".[citation needed]
